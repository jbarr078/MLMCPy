'''
This script demonstrates MLMCPy for simulating a spring-mass system with a
random spring stiffness to estimate the expected value of the maximum
displacement using multi-level Monte Carlo. Here, we use Model and RandomInput
objects with functional forms as inputs to MLMCPy. See the
/examples/spring_mass/from_data/ for an example of using precomputed data
in files as inputs.

Demonstrates the modular ("advanced") usage of MLMCPy where a user splits the
analysis into 3 steps/scripts. This is script #1 for initialization with
MLMCPy to determine how many model evaluations to do on each level and the
input parameters to perform the evaluations with.

# Step 1 - Compute the optimal sample sizes and store model inputs:

# Define random variable for spring stiffness:
# Need to provide a sampleable function to create RandomInput instance in MLMCPy
